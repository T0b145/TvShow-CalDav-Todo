# TVShow2CalDav

This is a small tool I used to stay up to date with my favourite TVShows.

## What does it do?
- Enter your favourite TV Shows in your Calender.
- The script will check if the TV shows are still running and will add all future episodes as subtasks with the specific airdate to it.
- If the TV-Show ended and it has no subtasks, it will delete the show from your tasks.

## Setup:
- Just fill the confic file and run the script.
